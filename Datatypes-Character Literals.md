# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a='T'
b='a'
print(a)
print(b)
```

## Output
![443915430-5852b3e6-7ac7-4ad9-b25a-3997917f0edc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31dc3133-9320-4d8e-b4d7-1e24d1529fbe)

## Result
Thus the program which prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is done successfully.
